vandal is a Python library for Data science and Machine learning, designed to aid researchers and engineers to meet their goals with small effort.

**Why vandal?**

As a vandal gives abandoned walls meaning with graffiti, so does vandal library to the data.

**Is vandal free to use?**

vandal is completely free of charge for both personal and commercial use, but only under the conditions stated in the license. Developing such a complex library isn't easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep vandal free is more than welcome.
